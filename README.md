# Tetris Game
This project is something I came up with as a challenge. My teacher was speaking of an upcoming assessment on building a Tetris game. He mentioned that it didn't matter how the students did it, as long as it was good. When I mean upcoming, I dont mean 2-5 months ahead. No. This assessment was 2 years into the future when my peers and I would have been more advanced at programming. The only language I could do it with was Python. So here I am. Using Godot or another language like javascript would have been an easier language. Python is not a language of games or UI nevertheless and Tetris game! I used coloured emojis like {ðŸŸ¥ ðŸŸ¦ ðŸŸ¨} to make a decent enough appeal. As of 2025. THIS IS THE HARDEST PROJECT I HAVE EVER DONE.

Getting "inspiration" from my code? 
Using the idea of emojis and pynput combined...

Guess what IDC! Just credit me and we're good!
